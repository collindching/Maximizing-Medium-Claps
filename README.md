In this project, I wanted to use data analysis to discover how content and formatting decisions impact a Medium article's claps, with the goal of using these insights to help me maximize claps on my own articles. To this end I scraped a year of data science articles from Medium, parsed those articles for features, and developed several regression models to predict claps.
