In this project, I wanted to use data analysis to discover how content and formatting decisions impact a Medium article's claps, with the goal of using these insights to help me maximize claps on my own articles. To this end I scraped a year of data science articles from Medium, parsed those articles for features, and developed several regression models to predict claps.

- Step 1: Scraping the data 
- Step 2: Data processing and feature engineering
- Step 3: Building a regression model
- Step 4: Interpreting the model
- Step 5: Visualizing the data and results
