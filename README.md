# Maximizing Medium Claps

_Uncover writing strategies for maximizing content engagement on Medium_

On Medium, claps are upvotes. They are a form of social currency with real impact, and articles that receive more claps are more likely to be recommended to new readers. This is critical for viewability. 

In this project, I wanted to use data analysis to discover how content and formatting decisions impact a Medium article's claps, with the goal of using these insights to help me maximize claps on my own articles.

To this end, I scraped a year of data science articles from Medium, parsed those articles for features, and developed several regression models to predict claps.
